This the the last project for the Foundation course from the Odin Project.
The project requires me to make a fully functioning calculator.
For now the calcualtor is able to perform basic operations easily.
The error handling is very basic and I would improve the calculator in the future as I get to know about more things in javascript in the upcoming courses of the Odin Project.
I would add decimal support very soon. So stay tuned for the update!
